# campaigns_analysis
**Objective:** Compare KPIs before and after starting campaigns and the most successful campaigns. 
## Project Overview
Running campaigns can be a key strategy for stakeholders to achieve their goals. Effective campaigns have the potential to attract more customers, and when executed properly, they can boost a company’s profitability and efficiency. To evaluate campaign performance, various Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) can be applied based on the company’s objectives. In this project, six KPIs are analyzed using nearly two years of transaction data from a retail business with 2,500 households. These KPIs are then used to rank the campaigns and determine which one was the most successful.

## Dataset Description
The datasets are obtained from [the Dunnhumby website (the complete Journey)](https://www.dunnhumby.com/source-files/), which is the first data science customer in the world. In this project, 4 tables are used.
